- Hi, I’m @AlexanderDKlein
- I’m interested in full-time Software Engineering/Development Positions.
- I’m acquired my Computer Science Bachelor's degree from GVSU.
- This is my project portfolio.
- Something to note: I have added a lot of these projects from my school GitHub account @Alexander-Klein-GVSU and my personal GitHub account @TheDragonOfLight, so anything from those two accounts means that I have either contributed to them or wrote them entirely on my own.
